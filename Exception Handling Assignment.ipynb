    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
    "Ans:When creating a custom exception in Python, it is recommended to inherit from the Exception class, which is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python.Consistency: Using the Exception class as the base class ensures that our custom exception follows the same design patterns and conventions as built-in exceptions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling: When a program encounters an exception, it typically handles it by catching the exception and taking some corrective action. By inheriting from the Exception class, our custom exception can be handled in the same way as built-in exceptions, making error handling more consistent and streamlined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization: By creating a custom exception, we can provide more context and information about the error that occurred. Inheriting from the Exception class provides us with a solid foundation for building out our custom exception, while still allowing us to add any additional attributes or behaviors that we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarity: By creating a custom exception, we can make the code more readable and easier to understand. This is especially true if we provide informative error messages that help developers pinpoint the root cause of the problem."

Here are two examples of errors defined in the ArithmeticError class \n",
